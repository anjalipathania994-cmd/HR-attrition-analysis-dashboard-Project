# HR-Attrition-Analysis-Dashboard-Project

An interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze employee attrition. This project identifies key problem areas (like new hire retention, low pay, and high-risk roles) by analyzing data by age, salary, job role, and tenure. The goal is to help HR make data-driven decisions to reduce attrition. Tools: Power BI, Power Query, DAX.

The dashboard was built using the followings tools and technologies:
. Power BI Desktop - Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
. Power Query - Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) - Used for calculated measures,dynamic visuals and conditional logic.
. File Format - .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews

Business Problem:
The company was losing too many employees, and it cost a lot of money to hire and train new people. The managers didn't know the real reasons why people were leaving or which departments had the biggest problem.

Key questions such as:
How many people are leaving?
Which departments are losing the most people?
What are the main reasons people are quitting (like salary, managers, or work-life balance)?
Are we losing new employees or older, experienced ones?

Key Visuals:
I used a mix of charts to tell the story behind the data:
KPI Cards (The Big Numbers): To show the most important numbers right at the top, like the "Total Attrition Rate (%)" and the "Total Number of Employees Who Left."
Column Chart: To compare attrition numbers between different departments (like Sales, HR, and Engineering) side-by-side.
Bar Chart: To show the top reasons why people were leaving (e.g., 'Low Salary' was the longest bar, meaning it was the top reason).
Line Chart: To show the trend of attrition over time. This helps see if the problem is getting better or worse each month.
Donut Chart: To show a quick percentage breakdown, like "Voluntary" vs. "Involuntary" attrition (did they quit or were they fired?).
Matrix (Table): To show more detailed information, like a breakdown of attrition by both "Department" and "Job Role" at the same time.

Business Impact and Insights:
This dashboard helped the company stop guessing and start taking action.
Impact: Instead of wasting money on company-wide changes, HR could now focus on the real problem areas.
Insight: For example, the dashboard clearly showed that the Sales team had the highest attrition rate (25%). The main reason was not bad managers, but low salary.
Action: Because of this insight, the company reviewed the salary and bonus plan for the Sales team, which helped in keeping more employees.
